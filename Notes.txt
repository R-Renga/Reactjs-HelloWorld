//Difference between framework and library?

1.The main difference between the framework and library is that inversion of control.

In library, you are in the charge of the flow of application.you need to decide when and where the 
library was needed.

In framework,framework in the charge of the flow of application,it give some places to put our code.

//REACT//

React is a free and open source front end javascript library for building web applications based on UI 
components.

React is a View in Mvc pattern ,user can the change the data or click around anywhere so view will react,so

//Virtual DOM
The virtual dom is nothing but the representation of real dom but the main difference is
for every change the vrtual dom only gets updated not a real dom,so the change only be re rendered.




//DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REACT AND REACT DOM
React is responsible for creating views also helpful for components
props ,state and other react stuffs and ReactDom is used to render the ui in browser



//CDN
CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK are handy and they require only minimum setups.
React CDNs are allow us to get all the features of react that we need.

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

DISADVANTAGE OF CDN
1.Restrictions
2.cost


//What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
react.production.js have the minified and optimized version of react




//CROSS ORGIN AND CROSS ORIGIN IN SCRIPT TAG

CORS = CROSS ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING
cors is the header based mechanism and that allows server to indicate any origin which means any domain, etc.
EXAMPLE :

A - B
if A need something from B means,first preflight cors mechanism will happen

A -> preflight REQUEST -> B
B-> CORS mechanism uses additional http headers to verify that request and b will send some additional
 http header -> A
A - > Actual to B Post ->B

SOME HTTP HEADERS
1.accept control allow origin : *
2.accept control allow methods (put,post,get,delete)

npm i cors
require
app.use(cors({
  origin:"*",
  methods :{PUT,POST,GET,DELETE}
}))

CROSS ORIGIN IN SCRIPT TAG - provide support for CORS
